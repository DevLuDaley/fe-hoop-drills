# Final Project Review Next Steps

Congratulations, you’ve submitted your final project for assessment and moved closer to graduation! But just because you’ve submitted the project doesn’t mean that there isn’t anything else for you to do. Here are a couple of things you can do while waiting for your assessment date:

* Review your Project Code - Now that you’ve completed your project, make sure that you go back to your project and do some light refactoring. It’s important not only that you understand how your code works but also that it is readable.

* Attend Portfolio Project Prep Study Group - Project Prep study groups are a great way to ensure that you understand what is going to be expected of you during the Final Project Assessment. Also, it’s a great way to make sure that you have met all the requirements.

* Review Previous Lessons and Labs - While your project was focused on building a project using React and Redux, it’s important to remember that we’re still writing JavaScript code. These are some key concepts to make sure you’re comfortable with before the assessment:

        * Hoisting and Scope
        * Constructors, Prototypes, and Classes
        * Higher Order Functions (Map, Sort, Filter, Reduce, etc…)
        * Fetch and Promises
* Review React concepts without Redux - While Redux is a great tool for building global state in applications, it’s important that we can separate the two from each other. Review the key concepts of React such as state, class vs functional components, render etc...

Along with the materials above, also make sure that you have completed the other key requirements needed to ensure graduation:
*     Complete All Projects - Ensure that you have completed the TTT with AI Project, Sinatra Fwitter Group Project, and the JS Tictactoe Rails API.
*     Complete over >95% of the Full Stack Web Development Track - In order to graduate you need to have completed over 95% of the material in the Full Stack Web Development track.
*     Publish All 7 Blog Posts - You need to have written and published 7 blog posts before you graduate. Since each project requires you to have submitted a blog post, you should have at least 5 blog posts already submitted.
